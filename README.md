# Arbor

Arbor is an experimental chat protocol that models a conversation
as a tree of messages instead of an ordered list. This means that
the conversation can organically diverge into several conversations
without the messages appearing interleaved.

You can get information about the Arbor project [here](https://man.sr.ht/~whereswaldon/arborchat/)

## This Repo

This repo houses the various specifications related to the Arbor chat protocol.

Right now this is only the basic protocol specification, but in the future we
expect it to also contain client-side protocol extension specifications and
recommendations for implementing clients and servers.
